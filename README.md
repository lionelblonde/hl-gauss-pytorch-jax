# HL-Gauss Loss (Histogram Loss) Reference impl.

Impl. (in PyTorch and in Jax) from the Appendix of the technical report from DeepMind:
"Stop Regressing: Training Value Functions via Classification for Scalable Deep RL".
([arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.03950v1).)

The __paper that introduces the loss and should be credited for it__ is:
"Improving regression performance with distributional losses".
([arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04613).)

This repo exists to act as future reference for myself, but might be useful for others to quickly
copy-paste the loss in their own projects.
